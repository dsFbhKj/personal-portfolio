# Personal-Portfolio

Hello Everyone this is my professional personal portfolio I built using React that showcases my skills, projects, and personal information.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm i`
When booting up the project be sure to install needed dependencies in the main project.

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. Your app is ready to be deployed!

### `npm run eject`

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single-build dependency from your project.
