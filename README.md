# Personal-Portfolio

Hello Everyone this is my professional personal portfolio I built using Next.js that showcases my skills, projects, and personal information.

## Getting Started

### `npm i`

When booting up the project be sure to install needed dependencies in the main project.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

```bash
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

## Learn More

Since this project runs on Next.js 14 you can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
